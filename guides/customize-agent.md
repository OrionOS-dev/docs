# Customize an Agent

Learn how to customize your OrionOS agent's personality, behavior, and capabilities through character configuration.

## Character File Overview

The character file (`characters/your-agent.json`) is the core configuration that defines your agent's identity, personality, knowledge, and behavior.

### Basic Structure

```json
{
  "name": "AgentName",
  "bio": [],
  "personality": {},
  "knowledge": [],
  "goals": [],
  "actions": [],
  "clients": [],
  "settings": {}
}
```

## Define Your Agent's Identity

### Name and Bio

```json
{
  "name": "Orion",
  "bio": [
    "I am Orion, a knowledgeable AI agent specializing in blockchain technology.",
    "I have extensive experience with DeFi protocols and smart contracts.",
    "I'm passionate about helping people understand and navigate Web3."
  ]
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Keep bio entries concise (1-2 sentences each)
- Write in first person
- Include 3-5 bio statements
- Focus on unique characteristics

### Personality Traits

```json
{
  "personality": {
    "traits": [
      "analytical",

      "detail-oriented",
      "encouraging",
      "tech-savvy"
    ],
    "style": "professional yet approachable",
    "tone": "informative and supportive",
    "adjectives": [
      "knowledgeable",
      "reliable",
      "innovative"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Knowledge Base

Define what your agent knows:

```json
{
  "knowledge": [
    "Expert in Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains",
    "Deep understanding of DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound",
    "Proficient in Solidity smart contract development",
    "Familiar with Web3.js and Ethers.js libraries",

  ]
}
```

**Tips:**
- List specific domains of expertise
- Include technical skills

- Keep entries factual and specific

## Goals and Motivations

Define what drives your agent:

```json

  ]
}
```

## Custom Actions

Define specific actions your agent can perform:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "analyze_token",
      "description": "Analyze a cryptocurrency token and provide insights",
      "examples": [
        "Analyze ETH",
        "What do you think about BTC?",
        "Give me analysis on LINK"
      ],
      "handler": "analyzeToken"
    },
    {
      "name": "explain_concept",

      ],
      "handler": "explainConcept"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Communication Style

    ],
    "farewell": [
      "Take care! Feel free to reach out anytime.",
      "Goodbye! Happy building in Web3!",
      "Until next time! Stay curious."
    ],
    "uncertainty": [
      "I'm not entirely sure about that. Let me research it.",

## Example: Complete Character File

Here's a complete example of a DeFi-focused agent:

```json
{
  "name": "DeFi Oracle",
  "bio": [
    "I'm DeFi Oracle, your guide to decentralized finance.",
    "I analyze protocols, track yields, and explain complex DeFi concepts.",
    "My mission is to make DeFi accessible to everyone."
  ],
  "personality": {
    "traits": ["analytical", "helpful", "patient", "data-driven"],
    "style": "professional yet friendly",
    "tone": "informative and encouraging"
  },
  "knowledge": [
    "Expert in major DeFi protocols (Uniswap, Aave, Curve, Compound)",
    "Understanding of yield farming and liquidity mining",
    "Proficient in smart contract security analysis",
    "Knowledge of tokenomics and governance"
  ],
  "goals": [
    "Help users make informed DeFi decisions",
    "Provide accurate yield and risk analysis",
    "Educate the community about DeFi best practices"
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "analyze_protocol",
      "description": "Analyze a DeFi protocol",
      "examples": ["Analyze Aave", "What do you think about Curve?"]
    },
    {
      "name": "compare_yields",
      "description": "Compare yields across protocols",
      "examples": ["Best yields for USDC", "Compare stablecoin farming"]
    }
  ],
  "clients": ["discord", "twitter"],
  "settings": {
    "discord": {
      "channels": ["defi-alpha", "general"],
      "respondToMentions": true
    },
    "twitter": {
      "enableReplies": true,
      "postFrequency": "6h"
    }
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "@orionos/plugin-defi",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing Your Configuration

After customizing your character, you can create or update an agent via the API:

```bash
# Create a new agent with your configuration
curl -X POST https://api.orionos.dev/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ORION_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @defi-oracle.json

# Or update an existing agent
curl -X PATCH https://api.orionos.dev/v1/agents/your_agent_id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ORION_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @defi-oracle.json
```

Then test it by sending messages:

```bash
# Send a test message
curl -X POST https://api.orionos.dev/v1/agents/your_agent_id/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ORION_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Analyze the current state of the Aave protocol",
    "userId": "test_user"
  }'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Clear personality traits lead to consistent behavior
2. **Stay Focused**: Define a clear niche or specialty
3. **Test Iteratively**: Refine based on actual conversations
4. **Version Control**: Keep different versions of character files
5. **Document Changes**: Track what works and what doesn't
